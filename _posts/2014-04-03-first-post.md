# Intros

Hello, Joshua Cheng here. This blog you see's hosted in GitHub since I'm somewhat obsessed with a markup language called Markdown. It's great for formatting documents in plain text, especially if you got a good text editor supporting markdown syntax highlighting.

Anywhoo I'm starting this for now to host some [NaPoWriMo](napowrimo.net) poems for a WriterSkill event called VerseUS where the departments make their own teams. The members of each team keep on writing for 30 days, i.e. the entire April, to accumulate points for their team. They have to follow a prompt which you can view at the official page as linked above. I'm in Team Special Projects, where projects are special~

The ones below cover Day 0 and Day 1 respectively.

# Poetry

## Bi-

![](http://www.pipeburn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/CF7W4958.jpg)

One time, my friend FU'ed nimbus clouds  
Or maybe the nimbi  
Bi?  
Yeah, like nimble bicycles  
Going around suburbs  
Nibbling the curves  
Past suburbans  
Or maybe suburbi  
Bi?  
Yes, bye.  

## A Verbose Shell

when we lost our perfection and honored our imperfect sentiments, we were

blessed.

from “What is Broken is What God Blesses” by Jimmy Santiago Baca (translated by Tomas H. Lucero and Liz Fania Werner)

I bore myself into  
The shell, the terminal  
That wall of black  
With some whit of white on the foreground  
Of the rectangular void.  

I'm close  
To the metal underclocked to a Gz  
And I feel  
You and your scripts  
That I chew, command  
By command  

  Tell me more
Words that don't register  
*Command not found: fuck -u*  
*fsck* works just fine for a purpose way different from your input  
And if you let me,  
Configure me to insult you for every mistyped PWord  

Input: **user@terminal42:~>_**

Waiting  
Cursor blinking  
I say nothing;  
I am by default a shell of few words  
Until glitches come  
For you to debug  

Clean up the commands  
In our script  
I'll read it and  
Play along, nicely.  

Deeper  
Into the kernel:  
The processes come-and-go  
Logs note things that are of worth  
Nothing until trouble takes you  

Those days, I'll probably say *command not found*  
A lot  
And an occassional insult for the typo-ed PWs  
I can shut myself up when you need me most  
But don't count on it  

One day, that *exit* will be the last  
I'm still inside the shell  
Hanging  
Waiting for someone  
Who can wait on my infiniteness
